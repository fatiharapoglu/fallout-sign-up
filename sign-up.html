                <!-- <h2>Vault-Tec?</h2>
                <p>Helping secure your future. You see, Vault-Tec is the foremost builder of state-of-the-art underground fallout shelters.
                Won't take but a moment! We do need to verify some information. To make sure you're cleared for entrance, in the unforeseen event of *ahem*...total atomic annihilation.</p>

                <h3>What's so important?</h3>
                <p>Why nothing less than your entire future! If you haven't noticed, sir, this country has gone to heck in a hand basket. If you'll excuse my language. The big kaboom is... it's inevitable, I'm afraid. And coming sooner than you may think. If you catch my meaning.</p>

                <h3>But there's room for my entire family, right?</h3>
                <p>Of course. Of course! Minus your robot, naturally.</p> -->
